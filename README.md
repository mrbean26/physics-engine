Game engine heavily based on physics concepts, building as a learning curve before a computational physics degree

Features Added To Game Engine:
  1. Object Oriented Component, Object and Scene
  2. 3D Viewmodel with object for texture, and OBJ file loading system
  3. Camera component
  4. Transform component with parent-child system
  5. Point and directional light sources with functional shadows
  6. Audio Source and Listener System
  7. Text
  8. Buttons / Images
  9. Scrollbar
  10. Dropdown box
  11. Particle system
  12. Collisions for any viewmodel
  13. Electrostatic and Gravitational Force system
  
Evaluation:
  1. Would create a system that would support magnetic force
  2. Would create a system that would support frictional resistive force
